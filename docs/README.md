# PesaGuard Documentation

This directory is organized by system concern and is intended to describe the platform’s actual structure, operational boundaries, and product responsibilities.

## Architecture foundation

The system foundation is documented here:

- [architecture/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](architecture/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) — purpose, boundaries, actors, responsibilities, and overview
- [architecture/COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](architecture/COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) — component model and runtime responsibilities
- [architecture/SERVICE_BOUNDARIES.md](architecture/SERVICE_BOUNDARIES.md) — clear ownership and interface boundaries
- [architecture/DEPENDENCY_MAP.md](architecture/DEPENDENCY_MAP.md) — internal and external service dependencies
- [architecture/DATA_FLOW.md](architecture/DATA_FLOW.md) — how money and events move through the platform
- [architecture/EVENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](architecture/EVENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) — event taxonomy, routing, and consumers
- [architecture/TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md](architecture/TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md) — validation points and sensitive boundaries
- [architecture/SYSTEM_INVARIANTS.md](architecture/SYSTEM_INVARIANTS.md) — the rules the platform must never violate
- [architecture/ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md](architecture/ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md) — the design principles the team follows

## Data engineering foundation

- [database/CORE_DATA_ENGINEERING.md](database/CORE_DATA_ENGINEERING.md) — ingestion, canonical model, transformations, lineage, catalog, retention, and governance
- [database/DATA_DICTIONARY.md](database/DATA_DICTIONARY.md) — field-level definitions for the platform’s core entities
